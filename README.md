# Tunley

Tunley is an app that displays tracks from the iTunes API and allows users to get more details about a specific track by tapping the track to present a detail view showing more information about the track.

## Required Features ##

[x]- View a list of tracks with their title, artist and album cover in a table view using custom table view cells.
[x]- Users should be able to view the UI in any screen size and orientation.
[x]- Tapping on a track takes the user to detail screen where they can view more information about it (artist, album, etc.).

For loading the track album cover, we'll use Nuke, a 3rd party image loading library installed via SPM.
